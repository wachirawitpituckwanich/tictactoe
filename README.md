# Design & Algorithm üßÆ

<h2>Figma Design</h2>

<h2>Algorithm</h2>

In order to determine the winner, we must check that all symbols in any of the rows, columns, diagonal or counterdiagonal are identical.

firstly, we check the row by using for-loop with the condition when i is equal to width of the board, we iterate and add all element in the rows into an array and check the array using function allElementSame which will return the first element in the array if all elements in the array are identical.

secondly, we will check the row by iterating through the entire board and push all elements in the rows into an array and checking it using function allElementSame.

thirdly, we check diagonal by iterating through the entire board with the condition when i mod width + 1 equals 0, we will push the elements in to the array and checking it.

lastly, we will check counterdiagonal by we check diagonal by iterating through the entire board with the condition when i mod width - 1 equals 0, we will push the elements in to the array and checking it.

once we get the winner we will display the winner's symbol. otherwise the website will display the next player
